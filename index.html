    <h1> A first title</h1>
    <p>This is the first paragraph</p>


    <p>The motivation behind writing this webpage is to give novice users of unix and linux a fast yet robust understanding of the commands and tools of unix.</p>


    <p>Unix is a very powerful set of tools designed to get the job done very fast and very efficiently without having to reimplement the wheel again.</p>


    <p>Through this easy-to-follow tutorials (I hope) we will address some of the most useful commands in linux and how to use them properly as well as how to configure them to our liking so they serve us well.</p>
